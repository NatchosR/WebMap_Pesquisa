### Warning about Support Plant Data
The data related to support plants should be interpreted with caution due to the following factors:

- **Involvement of Volunteers**: The samples were collected by volunteers, which may lead to errors in identification and categorization.
- **Difficult Verification**: The large number of samples makes it challenging and time-consuming to verify the accuracy of the results.
- **Potential Errors**: It is important to consider possible errors, such as incorrect GPS placement and miscategorization.

Please keep in mind that the surveys were conducted by non-professionals and that the identified trees are only a few months old, making their identification difficult. These considerations should be taken into account when using these results.
